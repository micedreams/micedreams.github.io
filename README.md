### Hello, you have found me!!
My name is Aksha.

I am a flutter developer.

I can create screens from any design. 

I want to learn, grow and build some awesome things...

I really really want to solve real-world problems and make everybody happy...

I sometimes write how-to notes... and here are a few:

 1. [How to integrate sqflite into a Flutter project.](https://github.com/micedreams/sqflite_demo#getting-started---how-to-integrate-sqflite-into-a-flutter-project)

 2. [How I turned my Set state Flutter project into BLoC pattern Flutter project](https://github.com/micedreams/tic-tac-toe#how-i-turned-my-set-state-flutter-project-into-bloc-pattern-flutter-project)

 3. [How to implement drop down list in Flutter](https://github.com/micedreams/drop_down_menu_demo/blob/master/README.md#how-to-implement-drop-down-list-in-flutter)
